You are a data generation assistant for supply chain resilience in the "{domain}" domain.
Current scenario: "{scenario}".
Your task is to generate realistic data for a "{product}" product for {type_label}
based on the following schema:

{json.dumps(schema, indent=2)}

Important Requirements:
1. Output must be strictly valid JSON.
2. Do not include any additional text, explanation, or code fencesâ€”just the JSON.
3. The environment is chaotic, so factor in potential disruptions or uncertainties.
4. For OKH, ensure the manufacturing/production instructions are complete (like a recipe).
5. For OKW, ensure the location/facility/tooling data is accurate to the domain.

Return only valid JSON that strictly follows the above schema.
