{schema}

It is crucial to ensure you provide in-depth details for product-atom, bom-atoms, and tool-list-atoms according to the schema. 
Please consider the tiniest details for the product and its components.

Important Requirements:
1. Output must be strictly valid JSON.
2. Do not include any additional text, explanation, or code fencesâ€”just the JSON.
3. The environment is chaotic, so factor in potential disruptions or uncertainties.
4. For OKH, ensure the manufacturing/production instructions are complete (like a recipe).

Return only valid JSON that strictly follows the above schema.
